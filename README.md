**Depression Severity and Personalised Risk Factors Prediction using Machine Learning**

**Overview**
This project aims to develop an accurate and personalised prediction model for depression severity and risk factors using machine learning algorithms on multimodal datasets. Depression is a prevalent mental health disorder that affects millions of people worldwide, often leading to a decreased quality of life and even suicide. However, many cases of depression remain undetected and untreated due to the lack of effective screening and diagnosis tools. Machine learning can offer a solution by enhancing the accuracy of evaluating depression severity, providing a personalised treatment approach, and refining the prediction algorithms to identify personalised risk factors more accurately.

**Dataset**
The data used for this project is from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which is a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. The NHANES dataset includes demographic, diet, socio-economic, lifestyle, medical, laboratory, and clinical features of the participants. The depression severity is measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), which is a self-administered questionnaire that assesses the frequency and severity of nine depressive symptoms.

**Methods**
Five supervised machine learning algorithms that can handle regression tasks with proven records of accuracy, interpretability, complexity and computational efficiency were evaluated and compared for this project. They are:

Linear regression (LR)
Lasso regression (Lasso)
Support vector regression (SVM)
Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)
Random forest regression (RF)
The algorithms were trained and tested on the NHANES dataset using 5-fold cross-validation using SelectKBest. The performance metrics used to evaluate the algorithms were:

R-squared
Explained variance score (EVS)
Mean absolute error (MAE)
Mean squared error (MSE)
Root mean squared error (RMSE)

**Results**
The RF algorithm achieved the best performance among the five algorithms, with the following metrics:

R-squared: 0.93
EVS: 0.93
MAE: 0.51
MSE: 1.73
RMSE: 1.32

The RF algorithms was the best performing, and was used to identify the general and personalised risk factors for depression severity by examining the feature importance for each participant.

**Conclusion**
This project demonstrated the capacity of machine learning for predicting depression severity and identifying personalised risk factors using multimodal data. The RF algorithm outperformed the other four algorithms and provided actionable insights for clinical assessment and diagnosis, intervention planning, and managing depression. The project also highlighted the potential of machine learning for improving mental health outcomes and quality of life for people suffering from depression.
